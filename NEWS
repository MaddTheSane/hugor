Git - 2015-02-08
================

  - Support for game-specific start-up configuration files. See the file:

      example.cfg

    for details.

  - The "Fullscreen Width" configuration option is now a percentage, rather
    than an absolute pixel value.

  - Fullscreen mode is now restored correctly between sessions.

  - Video is now fully supported in the Linux version of Hugor.  Consult the
    README for details about the GStreamer packages/plugins Hugor now depends
    on.  When building from source, video support can be disabled with:

      CONFIG+=disable-video

  - The FMOD sound back-end has been removed.  SDL is now the only supported
    sound back-end.

  - Games that expect mouse input will no longer receive right-clicks (or
    left-clicks on left-handed mouse devices), since this is reserved for the
    context menu.

  - If this version of Hugor is started for the first time, fullscreen mode will
    default to a 4:3 display ratio, as otherwise text lines can be extremely
    long on wide screen displays.

  - Context menu entries set by the game are now supported and displayed in the
    context menu.


1.0 - 2012-08-15
================

  (No record has been kept for versions older than 1.0.  The below are the
  changes since version 0.9.)

  - Fullscreen mode is now supported.  The maximum width of game output when
    in fullscreen is configurable (useful for widescreen displays.)  Switching
    to fullscreen and back can be done through the "View" menu, or by a
    platform-specific keyboard shortcut:

        KDE:      F11 or Shift+Ctrl+F
        Gnome:    Ctrl+F11
        Mac OS X: Ctrl+Command+F
        Windows:  F11 or Alt+Enter or Alt+Return

  - External tools that rely on real-time transcript updates (like Trizbort)
    should now work correctly.

  - The mouse cursor is now hidden when typing and brought back when moving the
    mouse.

  - Memory usage when playing music has been reduced.  Previously, the whole
    music file was mapped into memory as it was playing, increasing memory usage
    over time during playback.  Now the music is streamed as needed and memory
    usage stays constant over time.

  - When the "Mute Sound in Background" option was enabled, the sound would
    sometimes stay muted during very quick window focus changes (this can happen
    when launching Hugor through external scripts.)  This has (hopefully) been
    fixed.

  - Games that make use of MATCH_FOREGROUND for input would get a wrong color
    during text input.  This has been fixed.

  - The game window now has a context menu.  It simply provides quick access to
    the various main menu entries.

  - The scrollback window can now also be closed by clicking on its banner
    text.

  - Margins and their colors would sometimes display incorrectly after the
    scrollback window was displayed.  This has been fixed.
